Machine Learning and Image Analyze
1. MLP
  1) Create four types of dataset randomly.
  2) Four types of dataset are classified by Multiple Layer Perceptron
  3) Plot the classified graph
  
2. Reinforcement Learning
  1) Using reinforment Learning model to train the object to get the target and avoid the trap
  
3. "ImageSegmentation" is to segment the images.

  1) All the images are composed of textures from a small number of classes, sometimes appearing more than once in the patchwork.
  2) To generate histograms of the labels within a second fixed-sized MxM window that moves over the image (e.g. 25x25) (use np.bincount). Cluster the histograms using k-means, where K is the number of distinct textures observed in the source image

4. "KerasWithCNN" is to recognize the handwritten digits by Convolutional Neural Networ with keras.
  1) MNIST dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits from ‘0’ to ‘9’
